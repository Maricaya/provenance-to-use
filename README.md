# Provenance To Use

PTU is a Linux utility that captures a complete runtime environment,
dependencies, and program data - along with the associated provenance of each -
for any Linux application simply by studying a live sample of the application's
runtime behavior.  Subsequently, PTU can use the capture to reproduce and run
the whole application (or a specific subpart of it) on a bare Linux machine.

## Terms And Definitions

* __audit__: capture an application by running it with PTU
* __reference execution__: a single "run" of a captured application.  If the
  same application is captured multiple times, each run will produce a new
  reference execution.

## Usage

### Capturing An Application

#### Capture Commands

To capture an application (i.e. either an executable binary, or script file),
use  ptu to run the application:

        $ /path/to/provenance-to-use/ptu /path/to/binary-or-script [binary-or-script arguments]

For example:

        $ cd /home/user1
        $ /home/user1/provenance-to-use/ptu /usr/bin/mutt -R

The application will launch and run normally.  As it runs, PTU will capture and
package the applications environment, dependencies, and data.  When you quit the
application, the complete packaging will be copied to a new "ptu-package"
directory in the current working directory.

#### Created Capture Files

NOTE: this section may be of more use to PTU developers, and may not be
pertinent to users only interested in capturing and running applications.

After PTU is finished capturing an application, it will create a "ptu-package"
directory in the current working directory. The ptu-package directory will
contain the following important files and directories:

* `cde-root`: a directory containing a snapshot/sandbox of all files and
executables used by the app, stored in a directory structure identical to the
structure on the host machine.
* `[binary-or-script-name.cde]`: a special "shortcut" script that will run the
captured application from within the sandbox.  It will be located within the
`cde-root` dir in the same location that the above capture command was run from
(e.g. for the capture command example above, `mutt.cde` will be located at
`/home/user1/ptu-package/cde-root/home/user1/mutt.cde`).
* `cde-exec`: an executable program utilized by the shortcut script.  This
program redirects calls made by the captured application into the `cde-root`
sandbox.
* `cde.uname`: a text file containing details about the host machine's
architecture and operating system.
* `cde.full-environment.cde-root`: a text file containing all the environment
variables that existed when the capture command was run.
* `cde.options`: a text file containing user-configurable options that modify
the behavior of `cde-exec`.
* `cde.log`: a text file containing the commands used to execute the original
application capture.
* `provenance.cde-root.1.log`: a log file of all the processes, files, system
memory, and other resources accessed by the captured app while it was running.

### Running A Captured Application

#### Running The Captured Application

1. Change to the `ptu-package/cde-root` sandbox directory.

2. Change to the directory within `cde-root` that contains the shortcut script
file `[binary-or-script-name.cde]` (See
[Created Capture Files](#markdown-header-created-capture-files) above for
explanation).

3. Run the shortcut script file by invoking the same command (with the same
options) that was run to capture the application:

        $ /path/to/cde-root/path/to/binary-or-script.cde [binary-or-script arguments]

    For the above example, the following command would run the captured application:

        $ /home/user1/ptu-package/cde-root/home/user1/mutt.cde -R

```

## Git Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. [GITHUB PAGE] Fork the project repo:

    * click "fork" from https://bitbucket.org/depauldbgroup/provenance-to-use

2. [LOCAL] Create local repo:

        $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/YOUR-BITBUCKET-USERNAME/provenance-to-use.git

3. [LOCAL] Link upstream repo:

        $ git remote add upstream https://bitbucket.org/depauldbgroup/provenance-to-use

### Development Workflow

1. Find the issue you have been assigned, or assign a needed issue to yourself.

2. [LOCAL] Retrieve all changes from upstream.  Update local master branch and
sync it with your forked origin repo.  Create new local branches to track
upstream branches you want to follow locally:

        $ git fetch upstream
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge upstream/master
        $ git push origin master
        $ git branch --track [branch-name] upstream/[branch-name]

3. [LOCAL] Create and switch to a feature/fix branch for your issue:

        $ git checkout master
        $ git checkout -b feat-issuename

4. [LOCAL] Work on your feature branch:

        $ [edit existing files / new files]
        $ git add [existing/new files]
        $ git commit

5. [LOCAL] Periodically merge in upstream changes into your feature branch.
When working on feature branch for long periods, this merging reduces the
confusion that may come with a single large merge in step 8:

        $ git fetch upstream
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge upstream/master
        $ git push origin master
        $ git checkout feat-issuename
        $ git merge master

6. [LOCAL] Periodically push your feature branch to your forked origin repo
(to back it up), and also push your feature branch to upstream (so that others
may view and comment on your progress):

        $ git push origin feat-issuename
        $ git push upstream feat-issuename

7. [LOCAL] When complete with your feature branch, retrieve all changes from
upstream.  Update local master branch and sync it with your forked origin repo.
Create new local branches to track new upstream branches you want to follow
locally.  Update other existing local branches with their upstream counterparts:

        $ git fetch upstream
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge upstream/master
        $ git push origin master
        $ git branch --track [new-branch-name] upstream/[new-branch-name]
        $ git checkout [other-local-branch]
        $ git merge upstream/[other-local-branch]

8. [LOCAL] Merge changes from retrieved upstream master branch into your feature
branch:

        $ git checkout feat-issuename
        $ git merge master

9. [LOCAL - AS NEEDED] If merge notifies of conflicts, determine conflict files.
Edit and correct conflict files.  Flag conflict files as "corrected" by adding
them.  Finish the merge by committing:

        $ git status
        $ [edit and correct conflict files]
        $ git add [conflict files]
        $ git commit

10. [LOCAL] Condense all commits in your feature branch into one single commit:

        $ git rebase -i master

11. [LOCAL] Push your feature branch to your forked repo, and to upstream repo
(if others want to pull it down and test it).  Since you condensed your commits,
you will have to force/overwrite the uncondensed commits that currently exist
on origin and upstream:

        $ git push -f origin feat-issuename
        $ git push -f upstream feat-issuename

12. [GITHUB PAGE] Create pull request, specifying additions/changes and issue
number(s):

    * Pull request is FROM your-forked-repo/feat-issuename TO
      upstream-repo/master.

13. [GITHUB PAGE] If pull request rejected, begin again from Step #4.

14. [LOCAL] Delete the feature branch locally, from your forked origin repo, and
from upstream repo (if you pushed it to upstream in step 11):

        $ git branch -d feat-issuename
        $ git push origin --delete feat-issuename
        $ git push upstream --delete feat-issuename

### Merging Pull Requests

NOTE: do not merge your own pull requests.

1. [GITHUB PAGE] Make sure pull request commentary is properly descriptive.

2. [GITHUB PAGE] Review each changed/added line in each source file.

3. [GITHUB PAGE] Comment appropriately on specific source code sections.

4. [GITHUB PAGE] Merge or reject pull request.
